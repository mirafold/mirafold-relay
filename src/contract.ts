// repo (the open-core split, PLAN decision 2026-07-07). A separate repo can't
// import from genui-shell, so the tiny, stable routing contract is duplicated
// here. The daemon/browser copy is genui-shell's `server/relay-protocol.ts`;
// the shared constants below MUST stay byte-identical to it, and
// `server/relay-service.itest.ts` has a guard test that fails if they drift.
//
// The relay routes on `t`/`v`/`pair` ONLY. It never parses `p` — that is the
// end-to-end-encrypted WireMsg/ClientMsg payload, opaque ciphertext to us.
